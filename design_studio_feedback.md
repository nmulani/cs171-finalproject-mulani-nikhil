**Design Studio Feedback**

I received feedback on my design from Jake Sobstyl (Green Analytix).

It was useful to receive feedback from Jake, because he, like me, 
was working on a visualization that was based on an 
independent research project and understood the challenges 
involved.

After explaining my project to Jake, he primarily had feedback on 
the presentation of the data visualization. I had a smaller 
amount of background text than I do now - he suggested that I add 
a bit more context so that the user would become more 
interested in exploring the data visualizations. I was using keys 
for each of my pie charts and told him that I planned on 
creating more pie charts - he suggested that I eliminate the keys 
and use tooltips instead, if I planned on having such a large 
number of charts for the transactions section. I wasn't sure if I 
wanted to do this as a permanent design change, but it seemed 
like a useful temporary solution until I came up with a better 
way of showing how I was encoding information in my pie charts.

I found his feedback on web design in particular to be quite 
useful. When I showed him my design, I had each component 
implemented on a separate HTML page and had not yet implemented 
smooth transitions between them, beyond clunkily linking from 
each page. Jake suggested that I implement a floating CSS menu 
and put all of the elements on the same page, until I created the 
smoother transitions. It was a useful suggestion to create a more 
aesthetically pleasing and easily functional design for the 
code as it currently stands.

Overall, Jake's advice was solely focused on aesthetics, but seemed fair and helpful.
