All data is in the Data folder (xlsx files are in the Data/Exploratory folder)
All javascript implementations and libraries are in the Scripts folder.
All images are in the Images folder.

Most of the visualizations found here were built using D3.js, with the exception of the 
network diagram, which was constructed in Gephi and then animated using Sigma.js. The 
Datamaps library, with some custom modifications, was used to build the maps found on this 
website. Other libraries used include d3-tip, jQuery, Underscore and Bootstrap. See code 
for more credits and details. Technical tutorials by Mike Bostock, Mark DiMarco and Steve 
Hall were quite useful.

The information on this site is based on research done for my senior thesis, "Connectivity 
at Vindolanda." Transactional data was compiled by Kasper Gronlund Evers in "The 
Vindolanda Tablets and the Ancient Economy," and tablets were primarily accessed using the 
Vindolanda Tablets Online II database. All errors (of which there may be many, due to the 
fragmentary nature of the evidence) are my own.

None of this would have been possible without my thesis advisors, Emma Dench and Rebecca 
Katz. I also received invaluable advice and help along the way from Shane Bobrycki, 
Kathleen Coleman, the Center for History and Economics, Ian Kumekawa, Narendra Mulani, 
Nita Mulani, Ravi Mulani, Philip Pratt, Emma Rothschild, Alicia Solow-Niederman and Heidi 
Tworek.
